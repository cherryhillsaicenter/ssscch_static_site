<p><strong>Our center participates in Bhajans (Devotional singing ) from 3:30 - 4:30 pm</strong><br />As Sai Baba says, Nama-smarana or singing the name and glory of God is the easiest and yet the most effective method of unfolding the Divinity in our heart. When the fire burns the wood, it covers itself by a layer of ashes. You blowout the ash and see the burning fire. So too, the water in a pool gets concealed under its own green scum or marshy foliage. Remove this scum and you see pure water again. Even so, the Atman or the Blissful Self gets concealed under the cover of attachment and hatred and allied dualities. Nama-smarana is the best means to remove this cover and experience Divinity in our hearts. This sadhana (spiritual practise) puts to rest the fickle mind in the sweet love and glory of the Lord while the clapping of hands drives away the birds of attachment and hatred from our heart. The divine names we sing are potent mantras which have the power to sublimate our mind and help in developing faith and devotion. In fact, it becomes Nada-Brahma (Divine Sound) and puts us in touch with God and gives us the experience of His Ananda (Bliss).</p>
<p><strong>Study Circle is Followed by Bhajans from 4:40 - 5:30!</strong></p>
<p>Swami says, " Study circle means taking a point and each person discussing what is the meaning of the point to them. Each person gives their point of view, and finally values are derived from the discussion. If there is just reading, there is doubt. But if each one gives his view, doubts will be answered. The study circle looks at different facets. It is like a diamond with different facets, but there is one facet that is flat, the top facet, and from this all can be viewed. To discover the top facet is the task of the study circle. This does not mean only just reading and discussing and taking information into the head, but also putting into practice what is learnt."</p>
