<p>Sathya Sai Baba's teachings are universal and simple.<br />They are based on five fundamental human values:<br /><img class="size-full wp-image-5 alignleft" src="http://www.cherryhillsaicenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Values-for-the-end-of-the-page.jpg" alt="Values for the end of the page" width="171" height="179" />Truth<br />Peace<br />Love<br />Non-violence<br />Right Action</p>
<p>Sai Baba says that all religions are facets of the same Truth. Through Love and understanding, Baba encourages us to have unity of all people regardless of race, religion, color or gender. Sai Baba emphasized that all human beings are inherently divine. Like lost children, we have forgotten the art of living in harmony with our true nature. We have a birth right to regain this heritage. Baba is here on this earth to remind us of our roots. He taught us by example that, through practice of Love, compassion, generosity, forgiveness and sacrifice, all mankind can join together and usher in a new era of peace and harmony in the world. Sai Baba has come to reinforce our faith in our respective religions, and faith in ourselves and in the One All Pervading Supreme God.</p>
<p>He says: "Let the different faiths exist; let them flourish; let the glory of God be sung in all languages and in a variety of tunes. Respect the difference between the faiths and recognize them, so long as they do not extinguish the flame of Unity."</p>
<p>"Today, man visits temples and pilgrimage centers in search of peace, but peace is not found in pilgrimage centers. Peace is not found outside, it is within you. You are the embodiment of peace, truth and love. So search within, tread along the path of love. Only then you will be peaceful. Through love, you can achieve anything. God is Love, live in Love. Without love, you cannot be successful. Love helps you to know your Self. In order to experience love, you do not need to approach anybody; nor do you need to exert yourself. Turn you vision inward. Serve anybody; it amounts to serving God. The best way to love God is to love all and serve all. If you lead such a life, all your actions will be pleasing unto God. "</p>
